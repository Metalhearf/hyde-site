SwayOSD is already supported by HyDE. You just need to manually add the daemon for it to work.

### Quick setup

```bash
  exec-once = swayosd-server # enable swayosd service
  exec-once = $(pkexec swayosd-libinput-backend) # swayosd service for keyboard input (requires to be run in a subshell)
```
